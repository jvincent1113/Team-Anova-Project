Will: Why are some variables in the salary dataset description pdf not highlighted?

Alyssa: Minimum wage for both paid wage per year and prevailing wage submitted is $5.05.

I think in this case, you can transform them into a more aggregated level of salary, lets say monthly pay for all the observations:
if its hourly, you need to hourly wages * 40 hours (per week) * 52 (all the weeks in a year) and divided by 12 months to get a monthly pay rate.
if its biweekly, you just times by 2
if its annually, you divided by 12
I am just providing a suggestion, not sure with the context
