# DS311-Group-Project-Documentation

## Objectives
This group project is designed to bring first hand data-driven project experience to students. Students should be applying what they've learned in this course to explore the dataset which is chosen by the team. Students need to collaborate with their group memebers in this project and learn the project management skills.  I recommend students to treat this project as their profile project for the future job interviews. The more you contribute to the project, the better you can explain it in your job interview. 

## Dataset
Students are provided with 4 datasets from different industries as stated below.  Each dataset can be used to answer some specific business questions.  Each group needs to choose one out of the four to explore, analyze, and present to the class. You can find the datasets and the full description in this repository.

1. Dognition Subscription-Based Web Service Data (dognition folder)
2. Data-Drive Industry Salary Data (salary folder)
3. FIFA World Cup Data (sport folder)
4. Online Cars Sale Marketplace Data (sale folder)

## Technologies & Tools
Students are expected to perform the EDA analysis or other scientific analysis using the technologies or tools covered in this course.  They include, but not limited to, Python, SQL, R, Git, Tableau, Markdown, Business Dashboard, Story-Telling, etc. There is no requirement on what technology must be applied in your analytic process, but at least one of the three main tools (Python, R, or Tableau) should be applied.  

Plot (or graph) is often perferred over tabalets or text description. Make sure that you are including some intuitive data visualization in your final report and presentation. There are some nice visualization pacakges covered in this course such as MatPlotLib (Python), ggplot2 (R), and Tableau in general.  Make sure you discuss with your group members to create the plots that is best presenting the idea or summarizing the data.

## Git Collaboration
Each group **MUST** be working on and contributing to the project in **ONE** GitHub repository. Instructor will track the group members' commits (or contribution) to the project every week. If you plan to push only one **commit** by the end of the semester, you should expect to receive a very bad project participation grade on this project.  I am not requiring students to contribute every week, but students should make contribute once in a while (at least every 2 weeks).  Each group should discuss and assign work to each member every week and track their progress.  If there are issues or problems, the member should bring it up to the **team channel** and discuss.  If the problem cannot be resolved by the team, it can then be raised to the instructor.  There is no excuse for not contributing to the project regularly and documenting the issue on Slack team channel.

Note: Keep in mind that you should never submit a **pull request** to the remote **main branch** until you completed the task you are assigned for.  You can commit your changes locally and push upstream to your own development branch, but don't submit the **pull request** until you are certain about your work is done.  For example, if your team assign you to create 3 plots this week, you can commit each plot individually to the local branch and push them upstream to your remote branch. Once you checked and confirmed all your plots are correct, then you can make a final push to the upstream remote branch, then submit a pull request for your team members to review and approve your work.

## Presentation
Each team will have to do a short 15 - 20 minutes presentation.  The purpose of the presentation is for students to practice their presentation and story-telling skills. The presentation metrics will be provided to students later in this repository.  Generally speaking, each team needs to practice their presentation and make sure the messages are delivered within the time limit.

## Submission
The final project report and presentation material should be pushed to the project repository on GitHub.  To submit your final project, each team needs to submit only one GitHub repository link on iLearn.  Do not submit any data file, notebook file, script file, image file, markdown file, document file, etc on iLearn.  All you need to submit is the project repository link.

## References
- Two project reports from the previous semester are included in this repository for your reference.
